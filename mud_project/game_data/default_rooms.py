        "description": ( "The biting wind whips around you, carrying the scents of woodsmoke, baking bread, and damp earth from the nearby forest. You stand in the heart of Oakhaven, a bustling town square paved with worn, uneven cobblestones radiating outwards from the central well. The well itself is a sturdy structure of moss-speckled grey stone, its lip worn smooth by countless hands and buckets over generations. A thick, slightly frayed rope descends into the shadowed depths, secured to a weathered wooden beam overhead. Timber-framed buildings, some leaning companionably against their neighbours, crowd the edges of the square, their upper stories occasionally jutting out over the street. The sounds of town life echo here â€“ the distant clang of a hammer, the murmur of unseen conversations, the creak of a sign swaying in the breeze, all blending into the constant hum of this frontier settlement nestled against the wild."
        ),
        "description_night": ( "The moon casts long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Oakhaven's town square. Most windows are dark, though a warm glow spills from the tavern to the north-east. The central well stands as a dark silhouette, its depths even more mysterious. The usual daytime bustle is replaced by a hushed quiet, broken only by the chirp of crickets, the distant hoot of an owl, and the occasional drunken song from the tavern. The air is cool and carries the scent of dying embers and night-blooming flowers from small window boxes."
        ),
        "description_storm": ( "Rain lashes down, turning the cobblestones of the town square into slick, reflective mirrors. The wind howls through the gaps between buildings, making signs creak and groan protestingly. The central well is a dark maw, its rope soaked and heavy. People hurry past, heads down, or huddle in doorways. The usual sounds of town are drowned out by the roar of the storm, a primal force temporarily reclaiming Oakhaven from its inhabitants. Flashes of lightning briefly illuminate the square in stark, ghostly detail."

Twin towers of rough-hewn stone flank a colossal gate made from thick, iron-banded oak, scarred and weathered by time and conflict. Above, the menacing teeth of a heavy portcullis are visible, currently raised but ready to drop at a moment's notice. A lone Oakhaven Guard, clad in boiled leather armour bearing the town's oak leaf sigil, stands watch, their polearm held firmly, eyes scanning the northern approaches with practiced vigilance. The wind whistles through the crenellations high above, and you can feel the solid strength of the wall stretching away to the east and west, a bulwark against the dangers of the outside world.",

The gate itself shows signs of frequent use and repair, flanked by stone walls that continue the town's perimeter. A guard stands duty here, but their posture is less rigid than the northern sentry; they seem younger, perhaps greener, casting nervous glances towards the nearby forest and fidgeting with the strap of their shield. While secure, this gate feels more like a working entrance than a military stronghold.",

The air inside is thick with the metallic tang of cooling steel, the acrid bite of coal smoke from the perpetually glowing forge, and the faint scent of sweat and oil. Racks of serviceable swords, axes, and spears line the stone walls, interspersed with pieces of leather and chainmail armour awaiting repair or purchase. The rhythmic clang of a hammer striking an anvil dominates the soundscape, punctuated by the hissing sizzle of hot metal quenched in water. In the corner, a stout, muscular figure â€“ Grom the Blacksmith â€“ hammers relentlessly on a piece of glowing iron, his brow furrowed in concentration. Near the back, a battered training dummy, stuffed with straw and covered in countless dents and cuts, stands ready for practice blows. It's a place of practical craft and martial necessity, humming with latent energy.",
